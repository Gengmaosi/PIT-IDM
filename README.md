# PIT-IDM
The implementation of the paper "A Physics-Informed Transformer Model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction on Highways". Because of the confidentiality agreement and the commercial project application, the training part of the PIT-IDM has been deleted. Still, we upload the trajectory prediction demo code, i.e., 'predict.py', and 'PIT-IDM_1_UTE.tar' standing for the model already pre-trained on the UTE dataset.
