# PIT-IDM
The implementation of the paper "A Physics-Informed Transformer Model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction on Highways". The paper is now under review. Because of the confidentiality agreement and the commercial project application, the training part of the PIT-IDM has been deleted. Still, we upload the single trajectory visualization code, i.e., 'single vehicle trajectories visualization_UTE.ipynb', and trajectory prediction demo code, i.e., 'predict.py' and 'PIT-IDM_2_UTE.tar' stand for the models already pre-trained on the UTE dataset.
